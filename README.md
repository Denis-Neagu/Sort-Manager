# Sort Manager

#### Task

Create a Sort Manager application which allows a user to compare a variety of different sorting algorithms.

#### Requirements

* A user interface which allows the user to select a single sorting approach and a number of random ints to sort.
* The following sort options, at least: Bubble sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Insertion sort and Selection sort, Binary Tree-based sorting.
* The user should be able to run several sort approaches, or all of them, with the same test data.
* In all cases, execution time data should be provided using System.nanoTime() for timing.
* Exception handling should be included to deal with errors as appropriate. All errors should be logged to the console and a file, and normal execution events can be logged this way as well if desired.
* Design patterns (including MVC, factory method, facade), OOP and SOLID principles should be applied as appropriate. Interfaces should be used to avoid dependencies on concrete implementations. Java packages should be used to meaningfully divide your project into submodules.
* JUnit tests should be provided in a separate package to comprehensively test your project.
